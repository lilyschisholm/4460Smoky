        <h2>The Hidden Story of Recovery</h2>
        <p>
            For decades, the Great Smoky Mountains suffered from the invisible damage of industrial pollution — murky air,
            acidified rain, and stressed wildlife. But over time, coordinated environmental policies, conservation efforts,
            and ecosystem resilience have led to signs of recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            This visualization tells that story through data. We represent factors of the park including:
            <br/>
            <strong>park visibility</strong>, shown through the amount of particulate matter in the air, 
            <strong>water quality</strong>, shown through ANC levels in the water, and 
            <strong>biodiversity</strong> of the various types of species existing in the park. 
            Each dataset reveals a layer of resilience within the Smokies’ ecosystem.

                <p class="scene-intro">
                    The park’s iconic views once symbolized beauty — until air pollution turned it gray. The graph below tracks visibility
                    improvements over time, showing the results of decades of emission reductions after the <em>Clean Air Act</em> and
                    many other conservation efforts made by the national park servies. These efforts can be shown by the visualization 
                    as the less

                    there is, the more visible the Smoky Mountains will be. This is compared to the park's 
                    visitation data, displaying the direct correlation between park visbility and visitation.

                    Note: PM2.5(µg/m³) refers to the concentration of fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less, measured in micrograms per cubic meter of air.

        <p class="interpretation">
            <em>Less air pollution means more visitors:</em> Over time, visibility improves as emissions decline — a clear sign that air
            quality policy changes are working. This can be shown by the opacity of the area graph reducing as times go on, directly correlating
            with the increased park visitation. However, visibility, and park visitation alongside it, is slightly decreasing as conservation 
            efforts have slowed.

            Clearer skies are only the beginning. As pollution declines, the mountains begin to heal in less visible ways —
            starting with the chemistry of their streams and rivers.

            <h2>Streams That Remember</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Acid rain stripped minerals from the Smokies’ soils, lowering the pH of mountain streams and endangering fish and
                other aquatic populations. The <strong>Acid Neutralizing Capacity (ANC)</strong> dataset tracks how well streams can 
                buffer against acidification. Higher ANC means greater chemical stability and healthier habitats, allowing varieties 
                species to thrive. </br>
                Each cell represents ANC at a specific stream site and year (1993–2023).
                <strong>Darker = low buffering</strong>, <strong>brighter = high buffering (healthier)</strong>. <br></br>

                <p class="interpretation">
                    You may be wondering about Site 0174: why does that particular site have such a high ANC?
                    There isn't enough data to understand the exact cause, but deducing from the environment of the smokies, 
                    we can think of a few potential reasons! For example, this particular site might have an abundance of limestone bedrock,
                    which has a lot of carbonates and bicarbonates, making it well suited for neutralizing acids.
                    It could also be that this site has a lot of decomposing organic matter, and thus releases a lot of carbon dioxide,
                    which can help neutralize acids.

                    The trendline below shows how the park’s average stream ANC has changed over time — a direct measure of how
                    air-quality improvements affect water chemistry.

            <em>Slow Recovery following Efforts:</em> Starting in the early 2000s, ANC values gradually rise — reflecting fewer acidic inputs and
            the slow recovery of soil and stream chemistry. Cleaner air means healthier waters.

                The park's biodiversity data shows how different species populations have changed over time, reflecting the
                ecosystem's response to environmental improvements. With this, we can see how populations of different species 
                have increased or decreased over time, as well as see overall trends in biodiversity. These reflect the environment
                of the smokies, as well as conservation efforts. For example, in the 1990&apos;s - 2000&apos;s, when
                conservation efforts increased, you can see an overall increase in biodiversity! Decreases after this point are attributed
                to a loss of conservation efforts together with a lack of effort in recording of species.

        <h2>Conclusion: Interconnected Recovery</h2>
        <p>
            The Great Smoky Mountains’ recovery is not just a story of cleaner air or better water — it’s a reminder that
            ecosystems heal as systems. When air clears, streams recover. When water stabilizes, fish return. And when life
            thrives, people come back to celebrate it. This shows the importance of conservation efforts. The Great Smoky 
            Mountains have benefited greatly from the efforts of the National Park Services, showing how far conservation 
            effects can reach. We urge these efforts to be continued; the importance of these efforts effects every aspect 
            of our local, national, and global ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
            This cycle — from pollution to protection, from decline to renewal — shows that resilience is measurable,
            visualizable, and incredibly important.
