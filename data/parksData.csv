Great Smoky Mountains National Park, 22837,"The Great Smoky Mountains have a large number of species due to extensive conservation efforts and species inventory. This includes efforts like invasive species management, protecting bats from white-nose syndrome, restoring brook trout habitat, and keeping black bears protected. Efforts are still ongoing though, with help needed for things like maintaining wolf populations, and fixing the remaining air pollution. Climate change is also a large threat to the park." 
Zion National Park, 1801,"Zion National Park has done a lot of conservation efforts over the years but still faces many issues. The park particularly faces issues in staffing and funding, which has greatly strained conservation efforts. The impact of human activity on the parks has also caused issues for the park, namely in pollution as well as causing a decline in the cougar population. This has caused the native deer to overpopulate and raze plant populations."
Grand Canyon National Park, 2436,"Grand Canyon National Park has suffered from several issues stemming from the past, such as past uranium mining, and hydroelectric dams, which have contaminated the water and soil. It also faces water scarcity due to climate change, and wildlife is strained by invasive species and increased visitation. The park is currently fending these issue off with water conservation, sceintific research and monitoring, and connecting with local indigenous groups to help with conservation."
Yellowstone National Park, 1889,"Yellowstone National Park focuses a lot of conservation efforts on balancing wildlife with efforts such as the reintroduction of wolves to manage the deer population, as well as trying to mitigate the issue of global warming which causes an increase in pests such as bark beetles which destroy trees. Yellowstone also faces issues from mining and timber companies trying to use the land. The park works to maintain balance, partnering with indigenous groups to help bison populations, and using controlled burns to maintain forests."
Rocky Mountain National Park, 1492,"Rocky Mountain National park has faced several issues in its conservation, namely wildifres, flooding, and drought, which are expected to increase as climate change does. Because of this, bark beetles have also increased, destroying trees throughout the park. Glaciers the park relies on for water have been melting quickly, and most conservation efforts in the Rockies focus on mitigating the impact of climate change through controlled burns and keeping invasive species harming local wildlife in check."
Yosemite National Park, 2086,"Yosemite National Park is affcted by several issues, including invasive snails and plants, rising temperatures that impact the natural temperature cycles and wildlife, light pollution, overcrowding and overtourism, and budget cuts. This has affected the native wildlife greatly, and while staff work hard to mitigate the effects of these issues, the lack of funding means there are very few staff available to do much to help."
Acadia National Park, 1709,"Acadia National Park is a very different place than it was at its founding more than 105 years ago. While its beauty endures, its forests, lakes and coasts have been impacted through land use, pollution, tourism, invasive species, and, most pressingly, climate change. Park management works to mitigate invasive species, conserve endagered species, adding soil and plants to reduce erosion, and managing visitor behavior."
Olympic National Park, 1861,"Olympic National Park faces several issues, including hosting several engangered and threatened species, glacier loss due to global warming, pollution, habitat degradation, and budget cuts. The impacts of climate change greatly impact the park as it relies heavily on natural cycles affected by temperature and weather events, such as salmon runs and snowpack. The park is working to try and mitigate the effects of these, but budget cuts have reduced the number of staff able to help."
Grand Teton National Park, 2019,"Grand Teton National Park faces issues, like glacial melt, wildfires, human disruption, and invasive species. Climate change has a huge impact on the park, affecting the glaciers that the park relies on to survive. Air pollution is made worse by industrial causes, causing more particulate matter to be dispersed. Water temperatures have risen significantly, affecting fish and other aquatic animal and plant populations. Conservation efforts are focused on preserving species, and mitigating the effects of climate change."
Glacier National Park, 1652,"Glacier National Park is warming at nearly two times the global average, which is especially bad for a national park relying on glaciers to survive. It has also resulted in an increase in forest fires, which has in turn greatly disrupted wildlife. Many species which depend on changing temperatures to migrate or determine mating seasons have had their generational cycles disrupted as a result of climate change. This national park has also suffered budget cuts, and urges visitors to learn how to help with conservation."
